                            This study examines how China's administrative hierarchies shape the effectiveness of environmental regulation, revealing how central SOEs exploit their superior rank (e.g., SASAC oversight) to undermine the enforcement of local environment bureaus. Using a Triple Difference-in-Differences (DDD) design on 325,485 factory-year observations (2006-2013), we find: (1) higher-tier central SOEs receive more penalties but show weaker pollution reduction, especially when penalized by lower-ranked agencies; (2) market reactions to central SOE penalties are muted, reflecting perceived institutional immunity; and (3) top-down policies (e.g., 2007 Major Cities for Environmental Protection) improve local governance but fail in central SOE-dominated cities. We contribute to environmental governance literature by exposing how administrative hierarchies systematically empower central SOEs to circumvent local oversight, beyond traditional central-local incentive conflicts. Policy implications highlight the necessity of direct central government supervision to counterbalance central SOEs' structural advantages.

                           In the digital economy, data has emerged as a pivotal production factor, on par with labor and capital. Although prior research has explored the role of data in the economy and innovation, the role of data's tradability in the economy and innovation remains unclear. Our study fills this gap by investigating the impact of data marketization on firms' digital innovation output and production efficiency. Utilizing the staggered establishment of data trading platforms in China, we provide evidence that data marketization promotes digital innovation. Specifically, the establishment of a data trading platform within a province increases the number of digital innovations by firms by 11.96%, and ultimately raises the total factor productivity (TFP) by 4.9%. By measuring firms' data capital through accumulated data-related skills extracted from a comprehensive recruitment database, we find that the establishment of data trading platforms significantly facilitates the growth of firms' data capital. We also theoretically explain how firms' use of data enhances their digital innovation and productivity through a market game model involving data intermediaries. Our paper highlights the significance of data flow among enterprises for the growth of the business economy.

                            This paper proposes a unified framework to measure the formation and stock of data assets in China.
                            By incorporating data as a production factor and aligning cost, value-added, and intangible-asset
                            valuation methods with GDP accounting principles, we estimate the scale of the data economy and its
                            contribution to GDP. We find that data assets’ share in GDP has risen steadily over the past decade,
                            underscoring the increasing macroeconomic importance of data and the sensitivity of estimates to
                            alternative accounting approaches.
